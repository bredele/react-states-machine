Inspired by [mood](https://github.com/bredele/mood) this module is using the well known [finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) pattern to alleviate some of the issues that crop up in complex React applications by strictly separating the management of states from your components. This module stay true to the original intent behind React:
  - Describe states as static components only (dynamic relationships within a component are expressed outside of the component itself)
  - Describe the logic for handling changes/updates as simple functions (called transitions).
  - Describe changes as plain objects to pass as well defined and thought props.

In addition, this module makes easy to:
  - develop stateless components (easier to understand and maintain)
  - develop components in isolation (easier to reuse and scale)
  - test components (dynamic relationships between components are tested separately)
  - manage asynchronous changes

## Usage

A state is made of a component as well as a set of actions to be executed (called transitions). Those actions are called through transitions events and either update the current state or display a new state. A transition manage changes by passing props to the wanted state. The example below show a simple navigation flow


```js
import machine from 'react-states-machine'

function NavigationFlow (attrs) {
  return machine({
    // welcome state
    'welcome': [
      props => <button onClick={() => props.transition('click')}>Welcome</button>,
      {
        // click event transition from welcome state to next state with a new message prop
        'click': [() => ({message: 'Hello you!'}), 'next']
      }
    ],
    // next state
    'next': [
      props => {
        return (
          <div>
            <button onClick={() => props.goto('welcome')}>previous</button>
            {props.message}
            <button onClick={() => props.transition('update')}>next</button>
          </div>
        )
      },
      {
        // update event update next state with new message prop
        'update': [() => ({message: 'This is awesome!'})]
      }
    ]
  }, attrs)
}
```

React states machines works with react native, react dom and all environments using JSX.

## Getting started

A state machine is an object describing your application/component states.

```js
machine({
  state: [
    component,
    transitions
  ]
})
```

A state is composed of a component as well as an optional object containing transitions to mutate this component. Here's an example
that shows how to style an input when empty using a transition called `validity`:

```js
machine({
  'inputState': [
    props => <input className={props.invalid ? 'invalid' : ''} onChange={e => props.transition('validity', e.target.value)}/>,
    {
      'validity': [(prev, value) => {
        return {
          invalid: !value
        }
      }]
    }
  ]
})
```

A transition is a function used to pass props to your component and update it. A transition is also useful to describe the passage to an other state. Here's an example:

```js
machine({
  'formEmail': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <input type="email" />
          <button onClick={() => props.transition('next')}>next</button>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      next: [() => ({name: 'John Doe'}), 'formPassword']
    }
  ],
  'formPassword': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Hello {props.name}</h2>
          <input type="password" />
          <button>connect</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ]
})
```

But you also can go to an other state without transition:

```js
machine({
  'formEmail': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <input type="email" />
          <button onClick={() => props.goto('formPassword')}>next</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ],
  'formPassword': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Hello {props.name}</h2>
          <input type="password" />
          <button>connect</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ]
})
```
