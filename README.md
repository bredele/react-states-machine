Architecture your [React](https://reactjs.org/) components the right way using a simple and elegant finite state machine.

## Usage

```js
import machine from 'react-states-machine'

// describe flow using state machine
function Flow () {
  return (
    <div>
      {machine({
        'welcome': [
          props => <button onClick={() => props.transition('click')}>Welcome</button>,
          {
            'click': [
              () => ({message: 'Hello you!'}),
              'next'
            ]
          }
        ],
        'next': [
          props => {
            return (
              <div>
                <button onClick={() => props.goto('welcome')}>previous</button>
                {props.message}
                <button onClick={() => props.transition('update')}>next</button>
              </div>
            )
          },
          {
            'update': [() => ({message: 'This is awesome!'})]
          }
        ]
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

React states machines works with react native, react dom and all environments using JSX.

## Getting started

A state machine is an object describing your application/component states.

```js
machine({
  state: [
    component,
    transitions
  ]
})
```

A state is composed of a component as well as an optional object containing transitions to mutate this component. Here's an example
that shows how to style an input when empty using a transition called `validity`:

```js
machine({
  'inputState': [
    props => <input className={props.invalid ? 'invalid' : ''} onChange={e => props.transition('validity', e.target.value)}/>,
    {
      'validity': [(prev, value) => {
        return {
          invalid: !value
        }
      }]
    }
  ]
})
```

A transition is a function used to pass props to your component and update it. A transition is also useful to describe the passage to an other state. Here's an example:

```js
machine({
  'formEmail': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <input type="email" />
          <button onClick={() => props.transition('next')}>next</button>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      next: [() => ({name: 'John Doe'}), 'formPassword']
    }
  ],
  'formPassword': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Hello {props.name}</h2>
          <input type="password" />
          <button>connect</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ]
})
```

You also can go to an other state without transition:

```js
machine({
  'formEmail': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <input type="email" />
          <button onClick={() => props.goto('formPassword')}>next</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ],
  'formPassword': [
    props => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Hello {props.name}</h2>
          <input type="password" />
          <button>connect</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  ]
})
```
